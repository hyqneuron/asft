Test for single-block peak memory throughput

make run1: 28 LDs per iteration, 1 64-bit Address register
make run2: 26 LDs per iteration, 2 64-bit Address register
make run3: 24 LDs per iteration, 3 64-bit Address register

make run1 MAIN=mainL1: 48K L1
make run1 MAIN=mainEQ: 32K L1
make run1 MAIN=mainSM: 16K L1

make run1cg: similar to run1, but all LDs use .CG modifier (cache global)

Results:
Device is a GTX 480, clocks unknown
1. All 3 tests(run1, run2, run3) achieve a peak throughput of roughly 20.7 to 20.8 GB/s
2. mainSM and mainEQ are slightly faster than mainL1
3. run1cg achieved highest throughput of 21.4 GB/s
