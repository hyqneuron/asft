This is a trivial case of single-thread optimization.

Kernel involved:
__global__ void k(int *input, int *output, int count)
{
	for(int i =0; i<count; i++)
		output[i]=input[i]*16;
}

Performance:
command      : time taken to run
make original: 1032ms
make short   : 575 ms, 1.8x speed-up //involves an optimization that is not safe for huge array
make long    : 591 ms, 1.7x speed-up //safe
