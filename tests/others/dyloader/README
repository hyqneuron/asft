make test BLOCKS=_num_of_blocks_

the kernel loaded (loadee) is built from loadee.cu, which simply writes tid to output[tid]

loader kernel arguments: output_addr, loadee_addr, flag_addr, container_addr, loadee_size
0x20, 8: output_addr: device address for loadee to use, loader also uses this to output LEPC result
0x28, 8: loadee_addr: device address of loadee kernel 
0x30, 8: flag_addr  : device address containing the write flag 
0x38, 4: container_addr: the address of the kernel container in instruction space
0x3c, 4: loadee_size: size of loadee kernel, currently 0x50


loader.asf:
when flag == -1, return target LEPC result

when flag == 0
	block 0: load loadee, set flag, jump to container_addr
	other blocks: load flag and check flag
when flag == 1, jump to container_addr
