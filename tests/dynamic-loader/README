launch it using this command-line:
./main 1.k k 1


main.cu, main: the launcher utility
loadee.asf: ASM source for kernel to be loaded
loadee.k: cubin assembled from loadee.asf
the kernel in loadee.k modifies the memory content at the address specified by c[0x0][0x28~2f] to 1234
main then outputs that memory content.
